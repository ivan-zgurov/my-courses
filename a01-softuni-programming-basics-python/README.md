# Programming Basics with Python

### About the course

The "Programming Basics" course is part of the SoftUni Python Web Developer path. It provides the foundational programming skills required for all technology majors at Software University. This includes writing entry-level programming code (basic coding skills), working with an integrated development environment (IDE), using variables and data, operators and expressions, working with the console (reading input and printing results), using conditional statements (if, if-else), and loops (for, while). The course concludes with a practical programming exam, which serves as an entrance exam for SoftUni's software engineering program.
