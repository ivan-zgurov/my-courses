### About the course

Databases are the standard way to use dynamic information in modern technology, making them an integral part of almost every application. The intensive course on database fundamentals introduces students to one of the most widely used database management systems (DBMS) used in the development of modern information systems - PostgreSQL. The course takes a serious attention to the relational model, ER diagrams (tables and relational relationships) and working with the SQL language (data extraction, selection, projection, joins, aggregation, grouping, modification, deletion and insertion). Fundamental knowledge of working with functions, procedures, transactions and triggers is provided. This course lays the foundation for working with databases, making it easier to use them in real-world applications and understanding concepts such as converting a database into an object-oriented model (ORM).
